## @param outcome
##	Character vector indicating the outcome/medical-condition for which
##	we are calculating the num-th-ranked hospital name in each state.
##	Must be one of "heart attack," "heart failure," or "pneumonia."
##
## @param num
##	Either an integer vector or a character vector equal to "best" or
##	"worst." Indicates the rank of the hospital name that we are fetching
##	for each state.
##
## @return
##	A data frame where one column is the 2-letter state abbreviation and
##	the other is the num-th-ranked hospital name for that state. Rankings
##	are done by the 30-day-mortality rate for the given "outcome."
##	- Display an error message if the outcome is invalid.
##	- Display NA for a given state if num exceeds the number of hospitals
##	in that state.
